# MaskDetection
Yolov3 is an object detection network part of yolo family (Yolov1, Yolov2). It can detect various things of different sizes, runs quite fast and make real-time inference possible on various devices. It takes images as input, pass it through neural network and get a vector of bounding boxes and class predictions as output.
In this project we performed face mask detection using pre trained YOLO v3 model on face dataset. We created a face mask dataset and trained it on our YOLOv3 model.
